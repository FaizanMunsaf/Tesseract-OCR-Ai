Ql: One of the most attractive applications of public-key algorithms is
the establishment of a secure session key for a private-key algorithm
Stch as AES over an insecure channel.

Assume Bob has a pair of public/private keys for the RSA cryptosystem.
Develop a simple protocol using RSA which allows the two parties Alice
and Bob to agree on a shared secret key. Who determines the key in this
protocol, Alice, Bob, or both? (10- Marks)
